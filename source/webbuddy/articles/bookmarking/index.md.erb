Ah, bookmarks. The repository of all things we need, and only the things we need, nicely organised so they're easy to find.

Unless, you've been [babysitting them](browser-babysitting) properly, of course.

If you think bookmarking no longer works, we're with you. 

Bookmarking is no longer an effective way to recall important information when actually need it, in an age where your work spans across multiple devices and an ever-increasing inflow of data, and what you would deem valuable or bookmark-worthy is increasingly harder to decide.

If your bookmark folders are so messy you're irritated you even have to think back about them, you're not alone on this one either. Who has time to tidy their bookmarks? Wouldn't you rather be doing something more productive or fun?

*Do you really want to sit there, tidying your bookmarks?*

We don't. That's why we're building [WebBuddy 2](http://alpha.webbuddyapp.com). Bookmarks were fine things when they worked. But, in this day and age, bookmarks should be laid to rest.

If you'd like to learn more, please register to be notified when WebBuddy's mission statement is ready. Until then, our apologies for having to make you put the pieces of our story together -- it's because we're hard at work building stuff.
